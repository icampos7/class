Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.
The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.
Example 1:
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
Example 2:
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
Note:
1.	The input string length won't exceed 1000.	
Step 1: ask questions “how come the output is 6 if example 1 is the same as example 2”, “does the characters have to more than 2 or can it “ab” ”
Step 2: use IDEAL: identify the problem, what is the problem asking me to do and what does it mean. in this case the problem is asking to get the longest string
 	IDEAL: what does the problem mean? 
  In this case the problem is asking to find the largest length the goal is to print how long the string is.
IDEAL: Explore every possible solution, 
for example breaking the problem into smaller solution and explore every single problem, 
	IDEAL: Anticipate Outcomes what
  would be the input’s  if we try to input one string “a” or “aa”
	IDEAL: If the person who is 
  interviewing is not satisfy with the way I approach the problem then I would like some criticism, so I can improve my strategy and the next time I apply for a job I can use this as temple it to improve.
