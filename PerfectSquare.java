Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.
Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
Example 2:
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
Step1: question to ask “What does it mean perfect square number” 
“Does the numbers have to repeat to be perfect square?” “can you explain the second example” 
“is the question asking to skipping numbers” “how many numbers do you have to add to be a perfect square” 

Step 2: use I: identify the problem, what is the problem asking me to do and what does it mean. 
in this case the problem is asking to sum three numbers in the array however I doesn’t say the numbers can repeat.
            D: what does the problem mean? In this case the problem is asking to find the perfect square by adding n numbers 
            E.
            A: Explore every possible solution, for example breaking the problem into smaller solution and explore every single problem, 
in this problem I can break it into smaller one by first identifying what is a perfect square, what do I need to solve this problem.
            L:If the person who is interviewing is not satisfy with the way I approach the problem then I would like some criticism, so I can improve my strategy and the next time I apply for a job I can use this as temple it to improve.
