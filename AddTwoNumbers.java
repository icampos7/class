/*
Step 1: let’s say I get interview at google/Microsoft and I get this question; 
before starting to work on the problem I would read the problem carefully and I would ask question like 
“should the code only work for just two numbers” “what should be the worst-case scenario”

Step 2: use I: identify the problem, what is the problem asking me to do and what does it mean in this case the problem is asking to 
sum two numbers in a node/link list and I can safely assume the two numbers do not contain zero. 

D: Let’s assume I manage to understand the problem now 
starting thinking about the solution how would the solution look like and how can I get there.

E: Explore every possible solution, for example breaking the problem into smaller solution and explore every single problem,
in this problem I can break it into smaller one by first identifying how can I reverse the nodes and added to one another.

A: Anticipate Outcomes what would be the input’s if the user try different ones would my code still work.

L: If the person who is interviewing is not satisfy with the way I approach the problem then I would like some criticism
so I can improve my strategy and the next time I apply for a job I can use this as temple it to improve.
