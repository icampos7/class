Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize
the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.
Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
Example 2:
Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.
Step 1 Define the problem:The problem is asking to get the max product of the input 
if the input was 4 
the n it would be 4 = 2+2,2*2 = 4 so the max product can be 4 
first we ask are self is this an array? or is it safe to assume it just integers.
first get the user input
