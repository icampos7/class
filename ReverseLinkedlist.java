Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.
Example 1:
Input: 4->2->1->3
Output: 1->2->3->4
Example 2:
Input: -1->5->3->4->0
Output: -1->0->3->4->5

Step1: ask question “I’m allowed to use library”, “should I worry about negative numbers ” “I’m allowed to use recursion???”
Step 2: use IDEAL: identify the problem, what is the problem asking me to do and what does it mean. in this case the problem is asking to get the longest string
 	IDEAL: what does the problem mean? And how can I reach my goal??   
IDEAL: Explore every possible solution, 
	IDEAL: Anticipate Outcomes 
	IDEAL: If the person who is interviewing is not satisfy with the way I approach the problem then I would like some criticism, so I can improve my strategy and the next time I apply for a job I can use this as temple it to improve.
